    <p>Malicious URL detection plays a critical role for many cyber security applications, and clearly machine learning approaches are a promising direction.

        We have introduced different techniques used for the detection of the malicious URI. This technique is an add-on for the blacklist techniques, in which new malicious URLs cannot be identified and efficient for analyzing large number of URLs. In this proposed work the web crawling based web page mining perform effectively which will find the malicious content more effectively as compared to other so that the proposed D methodology will be highly effective as compared to previous. We have used effective algorithms like logistic regression to generate fast and effective results.
        
        This system can help many internet users to know that some URLs they are using might be a threat for their system or can perform various attacks. The main problem now a-days is you don't know if the link or any URL you're opening is safe or not. You never know hackers or attackers can attack your system and steal your data or cause threat to your system. It's better to check if the URL you're opening is malicious or clean However, the problem arises of the language. Some web pages under some URLs are in different languages. With the proposed system, we can only check the URLs having contents in English language.
