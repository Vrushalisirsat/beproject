Sign to text converter aims to interpret sign languages automatically by a computer in order to help the deaf communicate with hearing society conveniently In this system, feature detection and feature extraction of sign is done with the help of algorithm using image processing. All this work is done using software. With the help of this algorithm, a person can easily trained to convert sign to text Index Terms- Sign language Recognition, sign language convert recognition, Image processing, Feature detection, Feature extraction.
