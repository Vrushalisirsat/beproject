        Stepatography is the nn of hiding the fact that communicatum i 1919 M. my hiding information in other information. Many different care file frame carm used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency in the forma For hiding secret information in images, there exist a large variety of Rachniques sone are more complex than others and all of thein have responsive and weak points. Different applicntions have different requirements in the steganography technique used. For example, some applications may require and invisibility of the secret information, while others require a larger scret merase the hidden. This works intends to give an overview of image steganography, its was an techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steymurzadko algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganography techniques are more suitable for which applications.

Steganography differs from cryptography in the sense that where cryptysaphy focuses on keeping the contents of a message secret, steganography focuses on keeping the existence of a message secret Steganography and cryptography are both ways to protect information from unwanted parties but neither technology alone is perfect and can be compromised. Once the presence of hidden information is revealed or even suspected, the purpose of steganography is partly defeated. The strength of steganography can thus be amplified by combining it with cryptography. Two other technologies that are closely related to steganography are watermarking and fingerprinting.
