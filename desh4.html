    <p>This overview of some issues affecting nutrient solutions in soilless cultivation systems clearly highlights the main working topics in which the research world is involved in the field. The huge potential offered by this cultivation approach is indisputable and ranges from productive and qualitative advantages to environmental benefits due to higher efficiency in the use of water and nutritional resources.

        Currently, there are well-studied and tested research areas whose results are commonly exploited in the soilless cultivation such as the NO, management or the crop quality increase by managing the electric conductivity of the solution. On the other side, besides these positive aspects, there are others, more difficult to manage, related to the interactions among nutrients in their acquisition processes and the nutrient dynamics (bio geochemical cycles) in the hydroponic solution.
        
        These aspects represent a significant discriminate for the soilless management and, in some cases, may limit its diffusion, since the growers must possess specific knowledge and detailed skills to cope with and specifically per each crop species. It is interesting to note that parallel to the research areas dealing with these aspects, there are others newly emerging, technologically advanced but still not widely studied, even if they seem to provide promising tools (nano-particles, PGPRS) for a more efficient use of this hydroponic based cultivation approach. Progress has been rapid and result obtained in various countries have proved that this technology is thoroughly practical and has very definite advantages over conventional methods of crop production. People living in crowded city and streets, without gardens can grow fresh vegetables and barren and sterile areas can be made productive at relatively low cost.
