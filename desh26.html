    <p>With IOT based saline level monitoring system, the manual effort on the part of the nurses is saved. As the entire proposed system is automated, it requires very less human intervention. It will be advantageous at night as there will be no such requirement for the nurses to visit patient's bed every time to check the level of saline in the bottle since an alert notification will be sent to the nurses, doctors, caretakers when saline reaches the critical level. It will save the life of the patients. This will reduce the stress in continual monitoring by the doctor or nurse at an affordable cost. This automatic saline level monitoring system provides more flexibility to doctors, thereby the patients caring is enhanced. Hence it saves lots of time for doctor or nurse who is on duty. It also proposes the system which can automatically monitor the saline flow by using micro controller. The system is reliable cost effective and convenient for nurses. It can be reused for the next saline bottle. The system helps nurses to monitor the saline flow from a distance. It is mainly advantageous at night timing as there is no need for nurses to go to patient's bed to check the level of saline in the bottle
