    <p>Millions of children require school bus for pick up and drop to the school on an everyday basis. A safe transport for these children is one of the main concerns that need to be taken care of by the school management. Hence, the need for reliable management system of school bus in today's world has increased to a greater extent. We propose a Smart tracking system for School buses, which is an android based application designed and implemented to provide remote tracking and SMS mode of alert mechanism. The application is user friendly, interactive and secure, which uses Google API's to fetch the current location and GPS to track the school bus in real time. In order to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the ystem, this project presents the methods and workflow of different modules used in the application.

        GPS Tracker project is required to improve the safety of school children and remove unwanted money wastes. In this proposed system every student is given a smart Identity Card which will be an Active RFID Tag. It will be like a regular student ID Card. In this proposed system the alcohol sensors are will be placed within the bus unit to detect the alcohol level of the driver and issued the alert message to the parents. The fuel detection sensor are use to detect the fuel level in the bus. How much fuel is used by the driver and it will secure the theft of fuel. The mobile detection sensor is used to check whether the driver is talking on the mobile phone during driving.
