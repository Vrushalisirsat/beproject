        This project deals with the design and implementation of Smart surveillance nitoring System using Raspberry pi and PIR sensor for wireless image collection at DOP Data Collection Point). It increases the usage of mobile technology to pirerande ouential wildlife trapped images, security to our own system from being stolen, and for other control applications. The proposed system captures information in terms of irsage, and transmits it via a Wi-Fi adapter or 3G Dongle to a personal mail, Smart phone using web application. Raspberry pi operates and controls motion detectors and video cameras for remote sensing and surveillance of wildlife. It can also find the presence of someone located with the help of the Infrared sensor. For example, when motion is detected, the camera automatically initiates capturing and the Raspberry pi device alerts the owner of the possible intrusion having a smart phone to receive those captured images on his personal mail. Raspberry-Pi has two main components interacting with each other: one is the Wer Application that executes on the mobile device's browser and server-side scripts that run i a cloud which will be operated by the Raspberry Pi Hardware tool component.
