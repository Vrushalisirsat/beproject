    <p>Cardiovascular diseases or the heart diseases are one of the main causes for a very large number of deaths all over the world. Since last few decades the deaths happening due to heart have increased multi fold. This could be because of modern fast life, irregularities in routine activities and the life style that the people have, particularly in the medium to large and metro cities. Earlier, the heart diseases were considered as the ailment for elderly people but now even younger people, in their 30's and 40's face the heart problems which is a very alarming situation. Large number of researches are going on all over the world to analyse the causes of the heart diseases and find out the solution to curb this problem. The current project work aims at analysing the dataset to get insights of the data and understand data in depth. The project work also proposes to use various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to train the model and finally develop a prediction system to predict the future problems in the heart attacks.
