    <p>Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn.

        Electrocardiogram (ECG) provides an important information about cardiovascular performance, it is a noninvasive technique utilized as a main diagnostic appliance for cardiovascular diseases. The clear ECG signal supply valuable information about the electrophysiology of the heart diseases and is chemic changes that may happen. This research aims to extract the common features of the ECG signals based on Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT).
