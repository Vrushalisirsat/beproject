    <p>Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place. by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be usert, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet For hiding steret information in images, there exist a targe variety of steganography ruhniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications have different requirements of the steganography technique used. For example, some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a larger secret message to be hidden. This works intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganographic algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganography techniques are more suitable for which applications.

        Steganography differs from cryptography in the sense that where cryptography focuses on keeping the contents of a message secret, steganography focuses on keeping the existence of a message secret .Steganography and cryptography are both ways to protect information from unwanted parties but neither technology alone is perfect and can be compromised. Once the presence of hidden information is rvealed or even suspected, the purpose of steganography is partly defeated. The strength ot' steganography can thus be a Splified by combining it with cryptography. Two other technologies that are closely related to steganography are watermarking and fingerprinting.</p>
