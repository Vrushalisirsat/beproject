        Nowders, vontwling the traffic breumes major issue because of rapid increase in problemstilles and all Arvamse of large rime delays herwern traffic lights . Solving traffic Making which is up issue in mong mundern ches all over the world. So, in order to martin this problem, dersin. Based truffe lights system is developed this project explains Arew in compen the traffic based on density of ihletes. This system uses IR sensors 10 masure the maffic densin. IR sensor is there for cache road. These sensors will always mwitor the maffic on that particular rinud.

The Density Based traffic control is used in heavy traffic roads and the junction which is based on the time as well as the density and the time delay will be controlled and density will control by programe coded(Arduino). If the traffic density is high on particular side more priority is given for thar side. According to the outputs of sensors and as per given program stop time and go is change. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction.

All these sensors are interfaced to the Arduino which is the controller part of this system Based on these sensors outputs, arduino will detect the traffic and controls the

traffic system
