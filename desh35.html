    <p>In this project we actually worked on 5 currencies and it was found that the posed algorithm based on color and feature analysis works well for four cancies The USD banknotes has very minute difference when its come to size and onder making it difficult to recognize using proposed algorithm. But for NRAUD SAR the algorithm works very well.

        So we can conclude that with the above proposed algorithm we can recognize
        
        ancies which have good differentiation in color and size related to feature. Also
        
        NN based approach give quicker result.
        
        We also successfully retrieved currency conversion rates from the internet ng web service. In order to make this project widely useful and accurate, we can work on involving first line inspection methods in the algorithm and with this improvement this system could be avery useful tool in order to prevent high order merfeiting by taking advantages of cheaper and high quality equipment.
