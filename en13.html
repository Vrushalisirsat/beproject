        In this project, we propose a new intelligent gearing system that replaces, the manual gear shilling system of bicycle lsy, bar mounted shiller assembly which change the years hy measuring the body temperature of rider. This is an unique and impressive package which contain, temperature senser (MLX 10614). Anduino UNO board circuitry, power supply circuitry, shifter (geared DC mofor) which will be used for the gear changing and LCD display.

In market the bi-cycles are available for the people who want to maintain their health, as well as having atmosphere awareness. So in that case our product will be beneficial for the record of their health accordingly they will try to improve or maintain it. The main idea of a project came from the people who drives bicycles since there are little chances outside to have such product in market with the gear shall be shifted according to the driver's temperature. Ensuring enough availability of such product in the market would make bicycle seekers more attractive towards product.

The product may have extension by application of the product in the field of Bicycle Racing, in order to eliminate the complications involve in the remembrance of effective gears.
