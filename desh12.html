    <p>This Web Portal describes the development of Online System in order to assist the Outcome Based Education (OBE). OBE has become a model for learning environment and curriculum design for the educational system. OBE sets obvious educational goals and help the student to achieve those goals. The system is supporting the OBE in order to make transparent and objective evaluation of each student which is essential to introduce continuous quality improvement (CQI) as mandated by Engineering Accreditation Council (EAC). Moreover, the system will make effectively and efficiently for our use. Outcome-based Education (OBE) emphasis on two main components in terms of student achievement in an academic program, one is the Program Outcomes (POS) which is measured at the point of graduation and the other, the Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) is assessed over a longer period of time (around 4-5 years) after graduation. As a result, the aim is to address the development of web portal as an efficient and effective way to support the OBE model.
