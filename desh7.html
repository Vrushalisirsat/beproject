    <p>Computerized systems being an integral part of the current era, an automatic parking system is one of its most commonly used applications This Automatic paid parking system is designed to give access, exclusively to vehicles registered in the database. It takes the image of the vehicle and locates the license plate and identifies its license number. It then checks with the database to determine its access. In this project we have given detailed description of the image processing techniques used for Automatic Number Plate Recognition. It deals with computer vision and the various techniques used in image processing. The entire setup is compact enough to improve its portability and efficiency, whilst providing better security. now if any vehicle tries to enter the park, the gate will not be opened since there is no space The algorithms, train the machine for better pattern recognition to locate number plates. This system requires the vehicle to be physically present, so that security is not hampered. It records time period for which vehicle used parking slot ,according to time period money get calculated automatically and displays on the Led by which they can pay original calculated amount easily The work done indicated that the application of automatic car parking system would be able to detect and indicate the available car parking space
