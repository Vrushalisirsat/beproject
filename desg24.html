    <p>The objective of this work is to develop a real time hand gesture recognition alternative that depends upon the normal webcam. Through the analysis process we will show that the propose system can detect and recognize gesture with about 80% accuracy. The proposed system can be further improved by improving the tracking methods by using model based tracking.</p>
