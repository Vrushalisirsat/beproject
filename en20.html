    <p>Flood Detection using Sensor Network and Notification via SMS and presents a description of an alert generating system for flood detection. This is focused on the development of the system which will determine the current water level by means of sensors and by using wireless sensor network will then provide notification via GSM modem. A prototype of the proposed system is discussed in this seminar and the result of the testing phase is also elaborated. The architecture of the system can be expanded further to a fully functioning system in alerting the public of an impending disaster caused by flood.
