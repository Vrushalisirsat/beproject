    <p>In India most of the people prefer two wheelers compared to other form of vehicle. This is due to simplicity and its low cost and avoid traffic problems. One important problem is bike riders suffer from inadequate roads and bad driving conditions. Other important problem with bikers is that most of the time they don't like to wear helmet which could be fatal when accidents happen. Two wheelers in everyone's life play vital role, moreover the safety is considered to be primary of all. According to some statistics 50% of accident occurs due to bad conditions of road and not wearing helmet. To avoid accidents and to encourage people to wear helmet a project is to be introduced that includes smart interactive robotic helma with features like road hazard warning, wireless bike authentication and traffic adaptive mp3 playback. This helmet will warn the rider when road hazard is ahead, helblet will also helliet communicate with rider if he is not wearing it and will perform wireless bike authentication that act as prevention from theft. It will also adjust the volume of the speakers automatically while rider is listening to music as a safety precaution. Since in India the usage of two wheelers is more compared to four wheelers, it requires more attention as far as safety is concerned. we try to avoid accidents by using, a danger Zone indicator (RF transmitter) circuit, even though the accident occurred the vibration or MEMS sensor will activate the GPS to find the location and further SMS will send to ambulance and family members. This will optimize accidents as well as human death ratio by accidents due to providing proper care with in time frame. Another feature of the proposed system is the ability to detect an accident and send the corresponding geographical coordinates of the accident spor to predefined numbers using a GPS and GSM system respectively. After giving an overview of the system, the paper describes the system architecture, specific components used, logic flow employed and benefits of the system.
