    <p>A process of exchanging information, expressions and views between two and more than two people is communication. It can be either Verbal or Non-Verbal communication. Non-Verbal communications makes use of hand gestures for interaction. Hand Gestures can also be termed as sign language which works in a systematic way. With the help of this sign language it is becoming easier for people with disability to interact with the normal people. The people who suffers from hearing disabilities makes them different from others as they lack behind due to their impaired hearing as there is a system which is used by them to interact with normal people is SLR. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system basically used as an intermediate between normal people and hearing impaired. In this survey, various techniques that were implemented for sign language recognition along with the key points like the Classification Algorithms are discussed including the challenges and future scope too.

        Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, but since most people do not know sign language and interpreters are very difficult to come by we have come up with a real time method using neural networks for fingerspelling based american sign language. In our method, the video of hand gestures is first passed through a neural network which predicts and classify the class gestures. Our method provides accurate results for the 26 letters of the alphabet. the hand
