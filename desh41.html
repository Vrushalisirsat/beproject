    <p>In the proposed system, hidden knowledge will be extracted from the historical data by preparing datasets by applying Naive Byes algorithm. Predicting smart health can be done only is system responds that way. These datasets will be compared with the incoming queries and the final report will be generated using Association Rule Mining. Since this proposed methodology will work on real historical data, it will provide accurate and efficient results, which will help patients get diagnosis instantly. This system will also guide the users of how to remain healthy and fit using tips provided here. The further enhancements that can be done would be integrating this web application in an Android app. This will be available to users on mobile basis and its use can be further increased. Also feature like getting the doctor online on chat so that patients can directly talk to the concerned doctors. The modules doing cancer analysis can be integrated to find how close the person associated with cancer is

        This will make this web application predictable in true sense. The system is not fully automated, we may need doctors help for recognising diseases. Our system comprises of main components such as user's age, height, weight, blood pressure, gender, doing exercise or not. On these basis we have calculated disease that person can acquire, exercises recommendation, diet chart. Thus, it allows the users to get analysis on the symptoms they give for predicting the disease
