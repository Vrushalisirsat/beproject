    <p>Growing population has increased the need for the blood supply for various diseases. In every two seconds, some person required blood transfusion and currently India facing problem of the blood shortage. To address the problem an effective system is designed using the Internet of things. The system provides a methodology to fulfil the requirement of blood to the patients/victims without rushing to the blood bank to know the availability of the blood. An IR Sensors are connected to the Arduino board which continuously monitors the status of the available bloodstock.

        The output data provided by the Arduino is displayed on the webpage using the wifi module so anyone accesses the website and obtained the information of available bloodstock in real time. It will reduce the manpower required at the blood bank to update the online data also reduces the efforts of blood seeker of searching bloodstock at each blood bank. When bloodstock reaches to zero system helps to send a request message to the donor and nearest blood bank. By using loT the real-time available bloodstock is displaying on the website it minimizes the efforts of blood seeker.
