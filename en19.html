        This report addresses the Detection of Brain Tumor using Image Segmentation & Inhancement Nased on Gabor Waveler. Brain tumor detection system is developed in MATLAB environment. In this work MR Images are used because of their higher resolution. Image I've processing makes it ready to enhance. Pre-processing includes image resteing, conversion to pray and filtering. In this phase image is enhanced in the way that Å¿iner details are improved and noise is removed from the image. Most commonly used enhancement and noise reduction techniques are implemented that can gives best possible results. Enhancement will result in more prominent edges and a sharpened image is obtained, noise will be reduced thus reducing the blurring effect from the image. This work presents the Gabor wavelet analysis of the ROIs of a tumor image for extracting the texture features Edge detection. It will lead to find the edges of tumor. These images are then segmented by using thresholding The input gray scale image is converted into a binary format. The method is based on a threshold value which will convert gray scale image into a binary image format and then morphological operation used to give the final segmented output. The most basic morphological operations are Dilation and Erosion. Dilation adds pirels to the boundaries of objects in an image, while erosion removes pixels on object boundaries.
