        Hummingbird is a novel ultra-lightweight Cryptographie Algorithm aiming at ww-constrained devices. It has a hybrid structure of block cipher and stream ther and was developed with both lightweight software and lightweight hardware implementations for constrained devices in mind. Moreover, Hummingbird has been shown to be resistant to the most common attacks to block ciphers and stream ciphers including birthday attack, differential and linear cryplanalysis, structure attacks, algebraic attacks, cube attacks, etc.

This project provides the issues in Hummingbird Cryptographic Algorithm for efficiency, logic elements and throughput. This also introduces the concept of pipelining which improves the speed of execution. In this project, we have optimizes some blocks to get higher throughput and higher efficiency. This modification result into faster encryption and decryption of the message. Here the VHDL code is written for encryption and decryption of hummingbird cryptosystem. It is compiled and Simulated by using ModelSim SE 6.3f, synthesized by using Altera Quartus
