        The coin-based mobile battery charger developed in providing a unique service to la neral public where grid power is not available for partial/full daytime and a wyurce of ziemne four site posider the con-based mobile brillery charger can be quickly and sastha installed outside any business prenuises. The mobile phone market is a vast industry. and has spread into rural areas as an essential means of communication. While the urban xpulation uses more sophisticated mobiles with good power batteries lasting for several days, the rural population buys the pre-owned mobile phones that require charging trequently. Many times battery becomes Mat in the middle of conversation particularly at inconvenient times when access to a standard charger isn't possible. The coin-based mobile battery chargers are designed to solve this problem. The user has to plug the mobile phone into one of the adapters and insert a coin; the phone will then be given a micro-pulse for charging. It does not bring a mobile from 'dead' to fully charged state. The charging capacity of the mobile is designed with the help of pre-defined values. It is, of course. possible to continue charging the mobile by inserting more coins. This compact and lightweight product is designed to cater for the growing number of rural mobile users worldwide. A suitable microcontroller is programmed for all the controlling applications. The source for charging is obtained from direct power grid and solar energy in case of non-availability of grid power.
