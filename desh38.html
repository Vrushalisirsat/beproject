    <p>The proposed system is user-friendly, scalable, reliable and an expandable system. The proposed working model can also help in reducing treatment costs by providing Initial diagnostics in time. The model can also serve the purpose of training tool for medical students and will be a soft diagnostic tool available for physician and cardiologist. General physicians can utilize this tool for initial diagnosis of cardio-patients. There are many possible improvements that could be explored to improve the scalability and accuracy of this prediction system. As we have developed a generalized system, in future we can use this system for the analysis of different data sets. The performance of the health's diagnosis can be improved significantly by handling numerous class labels in the prediction process, and it can be another positive direction of research. In DM warehouse, generally, the dimensionality of the heart database is high, so identification and selection of significant attributes for better diagnosis of heart disease are very challenging tasks for future research
