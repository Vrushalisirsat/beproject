    <p>Our project investigated on a method to identify the bird species using a Machine Learning algorithm on the dataset for classification of image. The dataset consists of 100 categories or 1000 photos. The generated system is connected with a user-friendly website where users will upload photos for identification purposes and then it gives the desired output.

        This project works on the principle based on detection of a part and extracting
        
        algorithm features from multiple layers. These features are aggregated and then given to the classifier for classification purposes. On the basis of the results, that have been produced, our project has provided 80% to 85% accuracy in prediction of bird species.
