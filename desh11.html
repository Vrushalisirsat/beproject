    <p>The IoT based flood monitoring and detection system is done to save the lives on the people by reducing the human quick out at the emergency conditions. Here the maximum conditions are observed, and the risk alert is provided to the management. According to definitions of IOT, if we consider a sensor as an element of IOT which enables to communicate its current status and be published on Internet, then our proposal is very close to what we are intending to achieve within the concept of Internet of things.

        Nevertheless, the real intent of the proposal is to achieve a flood early warning system. So far, we have only built a micro-model through a prototype, that sends an audible signal and graphical messages towards smart-phones about the water level into a container.
