    <p>In this project we actually worked on 5 currencies and it was found that the proposed algorithm based on color and feature analysis works well for four cies. The USD banknotes has very minute difference when its come to size and color making it difficult to recognize using proposed algorithm. But for NRAUD the algorithm works very well.

        So we can conclude that with the above proposed algorithm we can recognize
        
        mencies which have good differentiation in color and size related to feature. Also
        
        NN based approach give quicker result.
        
        We also successfully retrieved currency convension rates from the internet using web service. In order to make this project widely useful and accurate, we can work on involving first line inspection methods in the algorithm and with this improvement this system could be very useful tool in order to prevent high onder counterfeiting by taking advantages of cheaper and high quality equipment.
