    The main aim of the project is to design # system lot pantry updation using memon device and wireless communication The witclone communication system takes the menu from cach coach and transmits the information to the pantry section. For wireless communication IEEE 802.15.4 based RF communication protocol is used between Host and Agents to establish wireless communication RF Module gives a low data rate, long battery life, and secure networking. It has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s; also the technology defined by the RF specification is sinpler and less expensive than other WPANs, such as Bluetooth. RF devices are often used in mesh network form to transmit data over longer distances, passing data through intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. This allows RF networks to be formed ad-hoc, with no centralized control or high-power transmitter/receiver able to reach all of the devices. Any RF device can be tasked with running the network. The low cost allows the technology to be widely deployed in wireless control and monitoring applications. Low power-usage allows longer life with smaller batteries. Mesh networking provides high reliability and more extensive range. Hence it is used for various applications like wireless home area networks (WHANs), such as wireless light switches with lamps, electrical meters with in-home-displays, and consumer electronics equipment via short-range radio. Another important component which forms the heart of the project and plays an important role in establishing communication between transceivers is the microcontroller which communicates with RF transceiver and sends the data to the transceiver.
