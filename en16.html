        The work of an engineer is to bring more comfort to human life: here we are thing to demonstrate the future of automotive. This idea is generated from the no different aspects. One is the medical and another one is the comfort. We have seen that in warm days, when we park our car at our office, school or home, car gets heated up and when we want to enter the car we will have to wait for few minutes by opening the windows. Also the other and most important reason is the plastic and fiber cover in the car emits Benzene which causes several diseases.

We have come up with a solution for this scenario, here we have used microcontroller as heart of system for generating all the control logic. Solar panel is main source of power which delivers power to the system and different power regulators are used for power conversions for the different sections. This solar panel is mounted on the roof of car the entire assembly will be residing in the door next to driver. Here we can use various cooling devices which will consume power from solar panel and this will keep the car cool when the car is parked. We can also charge slave battery which can be utilized for LED lighting in the car. Also as an advancement to this project various sensors can be interfaced for monitoring different parameters like speed, harsh braking etc.
