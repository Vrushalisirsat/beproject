    <p>Almost all Engineering College has introduced this scheme to have one to one interaction with students. For a batch of about fifteen students, teacher is assigned the role of teacher- Guardian. Teacher Guardian works as a friend, philosopher and guide for the students. They encourage the students to participate in co-curricular & extracurricular activities. They gives academic feedback to the parents/guardians regularly. They also counsels the students to solve difficulties encountered not only in college campus but in their personal lives too. Teacher guardian acts as a mentor to students and offers them emotional and academic support along with motivation.

        Teacher-Guardian Scheme is basically a web-based application for students, faculty and academic faculty in order to obtain student information quickly. This system is like a replacement for the traditional file system and avoids traditional paperwork. In this project, a student's complete academic records can be tracked thereby providing easy access to department staff and committee members. It avoids the need of tedious paperwork on the part of the students and students can then file their information through a computer and makes an easy process for submission as well as evaluation.
