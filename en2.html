    <p>Implimentation of Digital Trainer Kit has been presented. Anduino is a microcontroller atacant that has caprunt the imagination of electronics enthusiasts, Iis case of use and open que nature make it a great choice for anyone wanting to build clectronics projects litimately, it allow you to connect electronics through its pins so that it can control things for incang, tum lights or motors on and off or sense things such as light and temperature. This is utu te Antuino is sometimes given the the description physical computing. Because Aram can be conncted to your computer by a universal serial bus (USB) Icad. this also means that you can use Arduino as an interface board to control those same electronics from your computer. This kit consist of all the Digital experiments , which are easy and having reliable access inputs. Preety much everything else on the board is concerned with providing te board with power and allowing it to communicate with your desktop computer. Aim provided by Arduino within a single kit.
